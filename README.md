# TubeTracker
This program waits for the user to copy links of videos on YouTube. After copying all the URLs, the user can click Download and all the videos will be downloaded to their PC.
## Requirements:
- python
- PyQT
- yt_dlp

## Things to note:
- When running this application, it's better to run it inside an IDE as to not run into unexpected bugs. (I will still create an executable later on.)
- The GUI will go into an unresponsive state while downloading, *DO NOT CLOSE IT*, it will complete the downloads and then go back to normal.

## How to use:
1. Run the application.
2. Go to YouTube
3. Start copying the links/addresses of the videos you want to download. The URLs will show up in the GUI.
4. After you're done copying the links, click the Download button and wait for the downloads to finish.
